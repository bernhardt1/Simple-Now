Mindfulness Beginner,"The goal of the Mindfulness Beginner Course is to teach you how to practice mindfulness in your daily life.\n\nFor the next 30 days we will send you exercises to bring your attention back to the present.\n\nThis course recognizes that learning to be mindful takes daily practice. For best results, we recommend doing the exercises throughout your day instead of all at once. We will send you spaced out reminders to help you succeed in this.\n\nIf you have any feedback please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. We are continually developing additional courses and adjusting our existing offerings based on feedback from people like you.\n\nPlease enjoy!",102,,,,,,,,,,

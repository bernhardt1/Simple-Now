const STRING_ABOUT_PRACTICE_2 =
  'Practice helps you build mindfulness practices into your everyday life.\n\nIt uses a combination of mindfulness exercises, reflective questions and quotes from leading teachers to bring your attention back to your practice.\n\nAs you progress in the app you’ll find your reliance on the app decreasing. We like to think of it like an alarm clock. When you want to wake up earlier, you need the alarm to wake you up. Eventually, your body and mind get used to the new schedule and you start waking up earlier naturally.\n\nPractice works in a similar way. The app helps your body and mind develop the mindfulness patterns that you want in your life. Once the patterns are established, your reliance on the app decreases.\n\nOur goal with every person who uses Practice is to help them develop the mindfulness patterns they want in their lives.\n\nWe’re excited to continue introducing new mindfulness programs to help our members develop all kinds of practices into their lives. If there is a particular practice that you are trying to develop please contact us. We prioritize our program development based on demand so your voice makes a difference.\n\nLastly, we encourage everyone who uses Practice to incorporate meditation into their lives. Practice is a complementary tool to meditation and will help you incorporate what you learn while meditating into your daily life.\n\nGood luck in your practice! We wish you the best of luck on your journey.';

const HOW_TO_BREATH =
  'The most basic way to do mindful breathing is simply to focus your attention on your breath, the inhale and exhale. You can do this while standing, but ideally you’ll be sitting or even lying in a comfortable position. Your eyes may be open or closed, but you may find it easier to maintain your focus if you close your eyes.\n\nIt might help to start by taking an exaggerated breath: a deep inhale through your nostrils (3 seconds), hold your breath (2 seconds), and a long exhale through your mouth (4 seconds). Otherwise, simply observe each breath without trying to adjust it; it may help to focus on the rise and fall of your chest or the sensation through your nostrils. As you do so, you may find that your mind wanders, distracted by thoughts or bodily sensations. That’s OK. Just notice that this is happening and gently bring your attention back to your breath.';
const HOW_TO_SENSATION =
  'Begin by bringing your attention into your body. You can close your eyes if that’s comfortable for you.\n\nYou can notice your body, feel the weight of your body. Take a few deep breaths. As you take a deep breath, bring in more oxygen enlivening the body. As you exhale, have a sense of relaxing more deeply.\n\nBe aware of the sensation in the targeted area as best you can. Notice the area and see if you can allow it to soften.As you do so, you may find that your mind wanders, distracted by thoughts or other bodily sensations. That’s OK. Just notice that this is happening and gently bring your attention back to the targetted area.';
const HOW_TO_THOUGHT =
  'Take a few moments to settle into feeling the body as a whole, sitting and breathing. Close your eyes if that’s comfortable for you.\n\nAllow breath and body to recede into the background and invite the domain of thought to be center stage in the field of awareness.\n\nRather than being carried away by the content or emotional charge of individual thoughts, instead rest comfortably on the bank of the thoughts, allowing individual thoughts if and when they arise to be seen, felt, recognized and known, as thoughts as events in the field of awareness.';
const HOW_TO_HEAR =
  'Begin by bringing awareness to your ears as you become aware of hearing.\n\nTake a moment to recognize if you’re trying to listen. If so, stop trying. Instead, just allow the sounds to come to you. Notice that you have no control over when the next sound will come or what the next sound will be.\n\nAs you do this practice you may become aware of how the mind becomes busy with images or stories connected with the sounds. That is fine, just notice this and come back to being aware of the fundamental aspect of hearing. Sounds appearing and disappearing.';

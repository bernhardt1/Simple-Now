const STRING_ABOUT_PRACTICE_2 =
  'Practice helps you build mindfulness practices into your everyday life.\n\nIt uses a combination of mindfulness exercises, reflective questions and quotes from leading teachers to bring your attention back to your practice.\n\nAs you progress in the app you’ll find your reliance on the app decreasing. We like to think of it like an alarm clock. When you want to wake up earlier, you need the alarm to wake you up. Eventually, your body and mind get used to the new schedule and you start waking up earlier naturally.\n\nPractice works in a similar way. The app helps your body and mind develop the mindfulness patterns that you want in your life. Once the patterns are established, your reliance on the app decreases.\n\nOur goal with every person who uses Practice is to help them develop the mindfulness patterns they want in their lives.\n\nWe’re excited to continue introducing new mindfulness programs to help our members develop all kinds of practices into their lives. If there is a particular practice that you are trying to develop please contact us. We prioritize our program development based on demand so your voice makes a difference.\n\nLastly, we encourage everyone who uses Practice to incorporate meditation into their lives. Practice is a complementary tool to meditation and will help you incorporate what you learn while meditating into your daily life.\n\nGood luck in your practice! We wish you the best of luck on your journey.\n\n';

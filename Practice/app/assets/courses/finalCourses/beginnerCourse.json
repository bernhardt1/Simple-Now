{"title":"Mindfulness Beginner","information":"The goal of the Mindfulness Beginner Course is to help you practice mindfulness in your daily life.\n\nFor the next 7 days we will send you exercises to bring your attention back to the present.\n\nThis course recognizes that learning to be mindful takes daily practice. For best results, we recommend doing the exercises throughout your day instead of all at once. We will send you spaced out reminders to help you succeed in this.\n\nIf you have any feedback please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. We are continually developing additional courses and adjusting our existing offerings based on feedback from people like you.\n\nPlease enjoy!","id":102,"classes":[{"title":"Day 0","exercises":[{"title":"First Step","subheading":"Mindfulness Beginner Course","copy":"Mindfulness Beginner Course","instructions":"This 7 day course will help you practice mindfulness by sending you daily exercises.\n\nGood luck in your practice.","hasNext":true,"screenType":"instruction","image":"begin","reminderTime":null,"recommendedTime":null,"exerciseType":null,"notificationMessage":null},{"title":"Breath","subheading":null,"copy":"Take a few deep breaths then close your eyes and place your attention on your ribcage expanding and contracting as you breathe.","instructions":null,"hasNext":false,"screenType":null,"image":"sunrise","reminderTime":"06:00:00","recommendedTime":30000,"exerciseType":"Breath","notificationMessage":"Morning breath exercise"},{"title":"Sensation","subheading":null,"copy":"Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.

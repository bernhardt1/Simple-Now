  information:
    'The goal of the Awareness Beginner course is to help you build the mindfulness practice of awareness into your daily life.\n\nThis 30 day program will help you recognize how little control you have over your attention and give you opportunities throughout the day to come back to yourself.\n\nLike all our programs, we recommend combining Awareness Beginner with regular meditation. There are many great apps and books out there to help you learn mindfulness meditation.\n\nOur favorite app for learning mindfulness meditation is Waking Up by Sam Harris.\n\nOur favorite books on the subject are The Power Of Now by Eckhart Tolle and Awareness by Anthony DeMello.\n\nA small warning... Mindfulness isn’t something you can cram. Your results will suffer if you do the practices in one batch. You don’t want to be mindful once each day for 5 minutes afterall!\n\nIf you have any feedback please don’t hesitate to reach out. We are continually developing additional courses and adjusting the existing ones based on feedback from people like you.\n\nEnjoy!',
